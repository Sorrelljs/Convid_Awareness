    <h1>Aid Package for Canadians & Businesses</h1>
    <p class="page_entry_paragraph">
      Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a massive $82-billion aid
      package to help Canadians and businesses, including income supports, wage
      subsidies and tax deferrals amid the global COVID-19 pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>The emergency aid plan includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Temporarily boosting Canada Child Benefit payments, delivering about $2
        billion in extra support.
      </li>
      <li>
        New Emergency Care Benefit of up to $900 biweekly, up to 15 weeks, to
        provide income support to workers who have to stay home and don’t have
        access to paid sick leave. The measure could disburse up to $10 billion.
      </li>
      <li>A six-month, interest-free reprieve on student loan payments.</li>
      <li>Doubling the homeless care program.</li>
      <li> Extending the tax filing deadline to June 1.<strong></strong>
         For Personal Taxes</li>
     
    </ul>

    <h1><strong>Support for Canadians</strong></h1>

    <h2><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Temporary Income Support for Workers and Parents</span></strong></h2>
    <p>For Canadians without paid sick leave (or similar workplace accommodation) who are sick, 
        quarantined or forced to stay home to care for children, the Government is:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Waiving the one-week waiting period for those individuals in imposed quarantine that claim Employment Insurance (EI) sickness benefits. This temporary measure is in effect as of March 15, 2020.</li>
            <li>Waiving the requirement to provide a medical certificate to access EI sickness benefits.</li>
            <li>Introducing the Emergency Care Benefit providing up to $900 bi-weekly, for up to 15 weeks. This flat-payment Benefit would be administered through the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and provide income support to:
             </li><li>Workers, including the self-employed, who are quarantined or sick with COVID-19 but do not qualify for EI sickness benefits.</li>
            <li>Parents with children who require care or supervision due to school closures, and are unable to earn employment income, irrespective of whether they qualify for EI or not.</li>
                
        </ul>

        <p>Application for the Benefit will be available in April 2020, and require Canadians to attest that they meet the eligibility requirements. They will need to re-attest every two weeks to reconfirm their eligibility. Canadians will select one of three channels to apply for the Benefit:</p>

        <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Mortgage Default Management Tools</strong></span>
        <p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) and other mortgage insurers offer tools to lenders that can assist homeowners who may be experiencing financial difficulty. These include payment deferral, loan re-amortization, capitalization of outstanding interest arrears and other eligible expenses, and special payment arrangements.</p>
        <p>The Government, through CMHC, is providing increased flexibility for homeowners facing financial difficulties to defer mortgage payments on homeowner CMHC-insured mortgage loans. CMHC will permit lenders to allow payment deferral beginning immediately.</p>
   
        <h1><strong>Support for Businesses</strong></h1>
        <p>The Government of Canada is taking immediate, significant and decisive action to support Canadian businesses facing financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
        <p>On March 13, 2020, Minister of Finance Bill Morneau, Governor of the Bank of Canada Stephen Poloz, and Superintendent of Financial Institutions Jeremy Rudin outlined a coordinated package of measures to support the functioning of markets, the resilience of our financial sector, and continued access to financing for Canadian businesses. These actions will significantly increase the availability of credit to businesses of all sizes, sustain liquidity in key financial markets, and provide flexibility to businesses experiencing hardship.</p>
        <p>On March 18, 2020 the government and its partners announced further measures to support businesses. These actions are part of Canada’s whole-of-government response to COVID-19, and the significant stimulus program developed to stabilize Canada’s economy, support businesses and to protect Canadians.</p>
        <h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Supporting Canadian Business through the Canada Account</strong></span></h2>
        <p>The government is changing the Canada Account so that the Minister of Finance would now be able to determine the limit of the Canada Account in order to deal with exceptional circumstances. The Canada Account is administered by Export Development Canada (EDC) and is used by the government to support exporters when deemed to be in the national interest. This will allow the government to provide additional support to Canadian companies through loans, guarantees or insurance policies during these challenging times.</p>
        <h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Helping Businesses Keep their Workers</strong></span></h2>
        <p>To support businesses that are facing revenue losses and to help prevent lay-offs, the government is proposing to provide eligible small employers a temporary wage subsidy for a period of three months. The subsidy will be equal to 10% of remuneration paid during that period, up to a maximum subsidy of $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per employer. Businesses will be able to benefit immediately from this support by reducing their remittances of income tax withheld on their employees’ remuneration. Employers benefiting from this measure will include corporations eligible for the small business deduction, as well as non-profit organizations and charities.</p>
        <h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Flexibility for Businesses Filing Taxes</strong></span></h2>  
        <p>The Canada Revenue Agency will allow all businesses to defer, until after August 31, 2020, the payment of any income tax amounts that become owing on or after today and before September 2020. This relief would apply to tax balances due, as well as instalments, under Part I of the <i>Income Tax Act</i> . No interest or penalties will accumulate on these amounts during this period.</p>
        <p>The Canada Revenue Agency will not contact any small or medium (SME) businesses to initiate any post assessment GST/HST or Income Tax audits for the next four weeks. For the vast majority of businesses, the Canada Revenue Agency will temporarily suspend audit interaction with taxpayers and representatives.</p>
